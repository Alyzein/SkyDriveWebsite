        <p>Our History
            SkyDrive was founded in 2020 with a bold vision: to transform urban transportation by developing cutting-edge flying vehicles. The journey began in a small garage, where a passionate group of engineers and aviation enthusiasts collaborated to combine the principles of aerospace engineering with automotive design. Early prototypes faced numerous challenges, but the team's relentless dedication to innovation fueled their progress. Over the years, we conducted extensive research, received invaluable feedback from industry experts, and built partnerships with key stakeholders in aviation and technology.
            
            By 2022, SkyDrive made significant strides, unveiling its first operational prototype, the AeroX. This breakthrough not only garnered attention from investors but also ignited public interest in urban air mobility. Our team expanded rapidly, welcoming diverse talent from various fields, all united by a shared mission to make flying cars a reality. Today, as we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, we remain committed to leading the future of transportation with safety, sustainability, and cutting-edge technology at the forefront of our efforts.
